# AlphaZulu
If you occationally need to read mac addresses, alphanumeric serial numbers, or otherwise spell out words over the phone, this app can be very helpful if you don't do it often enough to memorize the phonetic alphabet.  I wrote it for myself years ago, and still use it today.  

If you would like to download the latest version of this app, [click here](https://github.com/njmill/AlphaZulu/releases/download/1.0.0.0/AlphaZulu_latest.zip).
